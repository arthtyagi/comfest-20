Comfest '20 - CF 09


Modules to be presented by CF-09 :

- Covid-19 Tracker
- Covid-19 Probability for a patient based on multiple parameters using Machine Learning techniques.
- Support Community app for Covid-19 patients.  

The overall suite is called, Supper. Just a random name ig, lol.

## Techniques used :

- Tracker - Fetching data from APIs and presenting them in a beautiful UI format.

- Covid-19 Probabilty ( Predictor ) - Scikit-Learn and/or possibly Streamlit for a minimalistic UI.

- Support application - Built using the likes of AJAX, Rest API to provide data to a Flutter application. Basically, revolves around the concept of providing the isolated COVID-19 patients with a community.

This makes Supper an application suite that provides people with proper support and efficient tools that are free and easy to use during these extremely tough times.
